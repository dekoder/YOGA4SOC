# YOGA4SOC
Your OSING Graphical Analyser For Security Operations Centers

Based on the work of Micah 'WebBreacher' Hoffman (https://yoga.osint.ninja/), this tool is finetuned to aid Security Event Analysis:

1) Some data and sources have been removed, due to lack of relevance in Security Event Analysis
2) Added SOC related internal/classified sources eg. Customer Footptinging database, Customer Network Maps, Incident Database, etc.
3) Added IDS/IPS events, their specific main datas, facts and metadatas
4) Added SIEM specific data, facts and their metadata
5) Added CERT activities, and all the related stuff
